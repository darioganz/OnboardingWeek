The "CryptoAlertBot.py" file is a python file providing a list of the 10 most traded crycurrencies price movement.
Every 5 minutes the bot produces as output the list of the 10 currencies with a either red or green square followed by th mention "bear" or "bull".
The color and bear/bull depend on the comparason of the now price with the previous 5 minutes ago price.
